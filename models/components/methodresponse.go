// MethodResponse - Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment
// method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The
// parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.
//
// You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen
// but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show
// payment methods from a specific country to your customer `['bancontact', 'belfius']`.
